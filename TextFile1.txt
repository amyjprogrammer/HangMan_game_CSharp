Things we need for the hangman project

1. Library
	a. repo for the guess
		i. check guess against the word (var UserGuess)
			1. make sure they haven't guessed the letter already (if statement, return cw- you already guessed that)
			2. make sure they gave a letter and not a number or special character(later)
		ii. store the letter to check against (store in a list to reference)
		iii. return- Right or Wrong (set to Halloween)
		a1.Win check- have they given us all the correct letters - if statement
			1. check if they still have lives left (if statement showing Game Over if they lost)
			2. later- have a dictionary of words (use random to pick from the list)
		iv. need to add something to the hangman or add the leter to the word
		v. set number of lives- 4 or 6 (depending on how nice we want to be)

2. Console App
	a. need to show blank spaces for the word they are guessing
	b. (hopefully)- show the hangman dude
	c. lives left (maybe pumpkins :)
	d. show letters that have already been guessed 
	e. maybe- check if they would like to play again (while loop)

3. When user gives guess
	a. check if they gave a letter- maybe
	b. check if the letter given is one they already guessed- maybe
	c. check if the letter is in the given word
		1. if yes- check if they have completed the word
			a. give Win statement
				i. ask if they would like to play again (while)
		2. if no- take a life and add to hangman(maybe)
			a. check if they have lives left
				1. if no- give Lose statement
					i. ask if they would like to play again (while)
			b. ask for another letter
